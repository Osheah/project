# Fishing Fisher's Flower Figures - An analysis of Fisher's Iris Dataset 
# Abstract
An exploritory investigation of the iris dataset using python and python packages. results showed data can illustrate descriptive analysis, inferential analysis and machine learning as well as show the usefulness of visualization in Data Analysis.  
# Introduction
The iris data set, also known as Fisher's iris data set, was popularised by the statisician Ronald Fisher in 1936 [Reference link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). It is a small dataset from 1936, consisting of 50 samples from three different species of the Iris flower, iris setosa ![iris setosa picture](img/setosa.jpg), iris virginica ![iris virginica picture](img/virginica.jpg) and iris versicolor ![iris versicolor](img/versicolor.jpg). Fisher measured the length and width of the iris's petals and sepals, in centimeters then analysed the data to investigate if these measurments alone could identify the species of iris. 

The iris data set is a useful and insightfull sample in which to apply data analysis. Its use in exploring machine learning algorithms and in data visualization is well documented. Historically, it is an early example of statistics applied to real data. The data set was collect and analysed by Roland Fisher, a famous biologist and statistian. The data set is small, 150 entries yet is sufficient to illustrate several areas where analysing data is insightful. Fisher's analysis showed two main clusters, with the iris setosa being clearly different from the other two. This seperation into two groups is an example of unsupervised clustering where the data is unlabled. If the samples are labled then three cluster group emerge, illustrating supervised clustering. [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis). 
The data consists of four measurments, the length and width of the petals in centimeters cm and the length and width of the sepal (the green leaf like structure below the flower attached to the stem) in cm ![picture of a sepal](https://amedia.britannica.com/700x450/39/91239-004-44353E32.jpg). 50 sampes of each of the three species were used giving a total of 150 datapoints.  
the iris data set is one of the most widely known ones in machine learning. Fisher's 1936 paper 'The use of multiple meausrments in taxonomic problems' has been widely cited. The data is used in machine learning as it shows clear encapuslation between the setosa and the other two species when the data is unlabled. if the data is labled by species then it is possbile to sepearate out the versicolor form the virginica species. The iris data is used in machine learning, particulary for testing sorting algorithms. This  however 
maybe add a bit on python and analysis 
# Method 
This project uses Python 5? and the libraries pandas, numpty?, matplotlib seaborn and sklearn?. It produces descriptive statistics of the data including the sepal/petal length and width
* max 
* min
* mean 

in addition inferential statistics are produced with 
* variance
* standard deviation
* skewness
* Kurtosis 

This project also produces data visualizations, including scatter plot, box plot etc.....


## Design
## Participants
## Apparatus and Materials
* data set - include it in the file /data/iris.csv
* python  
* internet
* python packages
* pandas
* mathplotlib
* seaborn
* numpty


## Procedure
research the dataset cite the references. 
# Results
put the findings here printouts graphs scatter plots etc

# Discussion
discuss the findings maybe a discussion of cluster analysis data mining unstructured data and structured data  mabye do colourful plots like maps?
